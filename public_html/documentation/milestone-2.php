    <h1>Whats to come</h1>
    <p>I don't want to start my relationship with Mrs. Maher off on a bad not. Keeping in mind that she has a lot
    to do today, I want to present her with a strong but simple page. I'm going to do my best to give her better
    than the basics, but get to the point right away. Here is what I think will be important to Mrs. Maher.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>background that includes my name that is not busy. It presents a warm feel that makes you
            appreciate open space</li>
        <li>navigation buttons to lead you to desired areas of the site. tabs will include who am I, capabilities,
        skills, resume, and contact.</li>
        <li>small who am I (about me section)</li>
        <li>capabilities section describing languages with experience</li>
        <li>skills section describing professional skills outside languages</li>

        <li>footer with contacts and links</li>
    </ul>.
