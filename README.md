## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here - you've clearly defined a purpose/audience/goal and Persona with enough details to begin to inform a design strategy.

Since your focus is on finding entry-level employment as a back end developer in a general sense, the choice to keep your focus on your code, skillset, and GitHub account is great. There are a number of GitHub widgets on the web that you might be interested in using for your project... look I found one here: http://lab.lepture.com/github-cards

Think about ways that you can illustrate your tech skill set and ongoing development projects that's clear, informative, and visually engaging. The use of some iconography and color along with simple and clear text content can be a simple way to add that professional "polish". Professional design can be simple: one or _maybe_ two colors, a nice font, good quality content, and maybe an image. It's really all about simplicity and balance.

Your project has been set up correctly and your code looks great. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
