## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here - you've clearly defined a purpose/audience/goal and Persona with enough details to begin to inform a design strategy.

Since your focus is on finding entry-level employment as a back end developer in a general sense, the choice to keep your focus on your code, skillset, and GitHub account is great. There are a number of GitHub widgets on the web that you might be interested in using for your project... look I found one here: http://lab.lepture.com/github-cards

Think about ways that you can illustrate your tech skill set and ongoing development projects that's clear, informative, and visually engaging. The use of some iconography and color along with simple and clear text content can be a simple way to add that professional "polish". Professional design can be simple: one or _maybe_ two colors, a nice font, good quality content, and maybe an image. It's really all about simplicity and balance.

Your project has been set up correctly and your code looks great. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). 

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
These are beautiful wireframes! They look great.... but they don't include the layout for all of your page sections though! What is your layout plan for "Who Am I", "Capabilities", "Skills", "Resume", and "Contact"? That's a lot of content regions that need a layout plan, and I'm concerned that you might not have a detailed enough plan/guide for your development phase.

The "Skills", "Resume" and "Contact" sections are the ones I am most curious about. These will likely be a bit more intricate than just a simple paragraph of text on a background. Where's the contact form going to go?

The wireframe you created is really nice - but it just needs to reflect the plan for your entire UI. At the very least, before you begin coding take time to sketch something out for yourself so you have a plan to go on. Your Content Strategy is great, so I'm confident that you have a pretty good idea of what you'd like to build.

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). If you'd like to update the wireframes by Wed 11/8/17 I'd be happy to bump your score to Tier III. Otherwise you're clear to begin development on your PWP.
